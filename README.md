# Java Recursive File System Simulation

This project implements a recursive file system explorer in Java, using object-oriented design to represent files and folders.

## ðŸ“¦ Structure

- `FileSystemElement`: Interface or abstract class for files/folders
- `Recursion`: Recursive operations like counting, summing, printing
- `TestCases`: Creates a mock file tree and runs recursion operations

## ðŸ§  Recursive Methods

- Count total elements
- Calculate total file size
- Pretty-print file structure
- Search for a file by name

## ðŸ§ª Run Instructions

```bash
javac src/*.java test/TestCases.java
java test.TestCases
